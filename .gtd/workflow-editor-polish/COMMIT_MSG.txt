feat(workflow): polish workflow editor with configurable global tools, condition routing, and i18n

Completed the Workflow Editor polish by implementing proper configuration for
Global Tools, enabling functional AI Condition (Router) node routing, and
ensuring full internationalization of all node labels. Added a new collapsible
Global Tools panel for better UX.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- Global Tools were simple checkboxes with no AI instructions.
- Condition (Router) nodes had no config UI and backend routing was not functional.
- Node labels on the canvas were hardcoded in English.
- Global Tools panel occupied constant space on screen.

**After:**
- Global Tools now have custom instructions to guide AI behavior.
- Condition nodes have a configurable prompt field and functional backend routing using a `route_decision` tool.
- All node labels across the canvas are fully internationalized (en/vi).
- Global Tools panel is collapsible with an enabled tool count badge.

## Implementation Details

The task was completed over 4 phases:

Phase 1: Refactored Global Tools data model to `GlobalToolConfig[]` and created a new configurable UI panel. Updated backend to inject instructions into LLM context.
Phase 2: Implemented routing logic for Condition nodes, including the `route_decision` tool and a configurable prompt field in the configuration panel.
Phase 3: Internationalized all node components (Start, Action, LLM, Condition) using standard i18n infrastructure.
Phase 4: Added collapsible functionality to the Global Tools panel to optimize workspace usage.
