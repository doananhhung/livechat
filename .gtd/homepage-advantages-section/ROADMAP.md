**Spec:** ./.gtd/homepage-advantages-section/SPEC.md
**Goal:** Enhance the Home Page with a professional "Advantages" section highlighting business-centric features.
**Created:** 2026-01-24

## Must-Haves

- [ ] Responsive grid layout for features (1-3 columns)
- [ ] 7 Feature Cards (AI, Widget, Management, Context, Canned, Notes, Templates)
- [ ] Lucide React icons for all features
- [ ] Full i18n support (EN/VI)

## Nice-To-Haves

- [ ] Subtle entry animations for cards

## Phases

<must-have>

### Phase 1: Content Foundation (i18n)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Objective**: Externalize all marketing copy for the 7 feature cards into `en.json` and `vi.json`. This ensures content is ready before UI implementation.

### Phase 2: Feature Section UI

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Objective**: Build the responsive "Advantages" section in `HomePage.tsx` using the defined i18n keys and Lucide icons. Ensure consistency with existing styling.
