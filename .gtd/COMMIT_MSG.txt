feat(ui): unify dashboard and widget theming with optimistic UI

Implemented a cohesive theming system that synchronizes visual design
across the Dashboard and Chat Widget, while adding real-time feedback
for agent messaging.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- Agent messages in the dashboard appeared only after server confirmation.
- Failed messages had no visual indication.
- Widget only supported LIGHT and DARK themes.
- A "Primary Color" picker allowed overriding theme branding, causing
  visual drift between dashboard and widget.
- Selecting a widget theme was "blind"—no preview until deployment.

**After:**
- Agent messages appear immediately with opacity + spinner (optimistic UI).
- Failed messages display a red error icon.
- Widget now supports all 14 dashboard themes (Cyberpunk, Dracula, Matcha, etc.).
- Primary color picker removed; widget strictly inherits theme colors.
- Live theme preview shows exact styling when selecting themes in settings.
- Message bubbles use unified `rounded-xl` styling with corner cuts.

## Implementation Details

Four-phase implementation to achieve full design parity:

Phase 1: Dashboard optimistic UI and bubble style standardization
- Added spinner/error icons for SENDING/FAILED states in MessagePane.tsx
- Updated bubble radius to rounded-xl matching widget

Phase 2: Theme infrastructure expansion
- Extended WidgetTheme enum to 14 themes
- Updated CSS generation pipeline for Shadow DOM theme injection
- Synchronized widget Message.tsx shapes with dashboard

Phase 3: Configuration and legacy cleanup
- Removed primaryColor from DTOs and shared types
- Updated ProjectWidgetSettingsDialog and ProjectSettingsPage
- Refactored widget components (Launcher, Header, FormRequest, etc.)

Phase 4: Live preview
- Created WidgetThemePreview component
- Integrated real-time preview into settings interfaces
