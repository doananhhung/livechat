feat(ai-workflow): fix audit issues and add reliability improvements

Addresses all critical issues identified in the AI Workflow Audit Report,
including race conditions, dead code, duplicated definitions, and fragile
system user logic.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- Multiple concurrent messages from the same visitor could cause race
  conditions in workflow state persistence
- AI tools used hardcoded 'system' string that would fail permission checks
- Tool names were duplicated across 3 files requiring manual sync
- Dead 'trigger' node type reference existed with no handler
- No automated tests for the locking mechanism

**After:**
- Redis-based per-visitor locking serializes message processing
- Dedicated System user (SYSTEM_USER_ID) with proper permission bypasses
- Single Source of Truth for tool definitions in @live-chat/shared-types
- Dead code removed from WorkflowEngineService
- 8 integration tests verify locking behaviour

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Created dedicated System user for AI actions
- Added GlobalRole.SYSTEM enum value
- Created SYSTEM_USER_ID constant and database migration
- Added deletion guard in UserService

Phase 2: Implemented Redis-based per-visitor locking
- Created VisitorLockService with atomic Redis operations
- Wrapped handleVisitorMessage with lock acquire/release
- 30-second TTL prevents deadlocks

Phase 3: Centralized tool definitions
- Created AiToolName enum in shared-types
- Updated backend and frontend to use shared definitions
- Added i18n label key mappings

Phase 4: Removed orphaned trigger node reference
- Cleaned dead code from getNodeContext()

Phase 5: Added integration tests for locking
- 8 test cases covering all lock scenarios
- Verifies race condition fix

Additional fix: Connected System user to tool execution
- AiToolExecutor now uses SYSTEM_USER_ID
- ConversationService and ActionsService bypass membership checks for System user
