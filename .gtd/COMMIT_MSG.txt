feat(frontend): implement multi-theme support with 10 new themes

Add a comprehensive theming system with 10 new curated themes: OLED Void,
Paperback, Nordic Frost, Cyberpunk, Terminal, Matcha, Dracula, Lavender Mist,
High Contrast, and Solarized (Light/Dark variants). The total theme count
increases from 3 to 14 selectable options.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- Only 3 themes available: Light, Dark, System.
- Theme switching was instant with no transitions.
- No custom color palettes beyond default light/dark.

**After:**
- 14 themes available with curated color palettes.
- Smooth 150ms transitions on theme switch.
- Themes grouped in UI: Base (Light/Dark/System), Dark themes, Light themes.
- Scrollbar colors auto-adapt via CSS variables.
- Active theme indicated with checkmark in dropdown.

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Expanded `Theme` type to 14 variants, refactored `applyTheme` to
handle custom classes with light/dark base mapping, added i18n keys.

Phase 2: Defined 11 CSS palette classes with 15+ HSL variables each
(background, foreground, card, primary, secondary, muted, accent, etc.).

Phase 3: Updated `UserNav.tsx` and `ThemeToggleButton.tsx` to display all
themes with grouping, separators, and checkmark indicators.

Phase 4: Added 150ms transitions to body and common utility classes for
smooth theme switching.

Bug fix: Moved theme classes out of `@layer base` to prevent Tailwind JIT
purging (classes are constructed dynamically). Fixed `nordic-frost` dark
mode logic. Corrected `darkMode` config in tailwind.config.js.
