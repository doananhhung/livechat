refactor(ai-responder): complete refactor of workflow orchestration and event lifecycle

This commit completes the comprehensive refactor of the `AiResponderService`
and its integration with the `WorkflowEngineService`. The primary goals 
achieved were eliminating duplicated logic, improving architectural 
separation, and resolving critical issues in the event lifecycle.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- `AiResponderService` had duplicated hardcoded logic for routing nodes.
- Action nodes auto-executed tools without LLM context.
- AI lifecycle had race conditions; could process before message persistence.
- Condition nodes were "sticky" and evaluated full history.
- Multiple DB writes occurred per turn.

**After:**
- Single entry point for workflow processing in the engine.
- Action nodes are intelligently handled by the LLM.
- AI lifecycle is robust and event-driven post-persistence.
- Condition nodes evaluate based on the latest user message.
- At most one DB write for conversation metadata per turn.

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Engine updated for LLM-driven actions and standardized routing.
Phase 2: Responder refactored to delegate logic and remove dead code.
Phase 3: DB writes optimized; event lifecycle and logic scope issues fixed.
