feat(workflow-editor): complete node management and branching logic

Implemented full CRUD capabilities for the WorkflowEditor, including a
node toolbar for adding nodes, a delete mechanism in the configuration
panel, and keyboard shortcuts for element removal. Enhanced the 
ConditionNode with Yes/No branching handles and added box selection 
for improved UX.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:** Users could only view and configure existing workflow nodes. 
There was no way to add new nodes, delete elements, or create 
conditional branches.

**After:** Users can now add all node types (Start, Action, LLM, Condition) 
via a dedicated toolbar. Nodes and edges can be deleted via UI buttons 
or keyboard shortcuts. Condition nodes support specific Yes/No 
branching, and users can multi-select elements using box selection.

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Created NodeToolbar component and implemented node addition logic 
with unique ID generation and smart positioning.
Phase 2: Added Delete button to NodeConfigPanel and implemented node/edge 
deletion logic in WorkflowEditor.
Phase 3: Enhanced ConditionNode with dual output handles (Yes/No) and 
enabled box selection/keyboard deletion in React Flow.
