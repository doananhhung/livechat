feat(ai-workflow): harden reliability, safety, and configuration

Implemented a comprehensive remediation plan for the AI subsystem to address
critical race conditions, runtime safety issues, and configuration fragmentation.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:**
- AI updates could overwrite concurrent human agent actions (race condition causing data loss).
- Malformed workflow nodes caused runtime crashes (undefined property access).
- AI configuration was split between legacy columns and JSON, creating ambiguity.

**After:**
- AI updates are atomic (`update()` vs `save()`), handling concurrent changes safely.
- Workflow execution is guarded by Zod schemas; invalid nodes fail gracefully with clear errors.
- Configuration is unified under `aiConfig`, with transparent fallback to legacy fields for backward compatibility.

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Reliability Hardening
- Refactored `AiResponderService` to use atomic updates.
- Verified fix with `ai-concurrency.e2e-spec.ts`.

Phase 2: Runtime Safety
- Added Zod schemas for `WorkflowNode`, `ToolData`, and `ConditionData`.
- Enforced schema validation in `WorkflowEngineService.executeStep`.

Phase 3: Configuration Cleanup
- Deprecated `aiResponderEnabled` and `aiResponderPrompt` in `Project` entity.
- Implemented fallback logic in `AiResponderService` to prioritize `aiConfig`.

Phase 4: Verification
- Added reproduction E2E test proving concurrency safety.
