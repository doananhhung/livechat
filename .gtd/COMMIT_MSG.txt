feat(ai-lang): implement AI responder language configuration and enforcement

Added a project-level setting to force the AI Responder to operate consistently in a specific language (English or Vietnamese). This ensures reliable, native-language responses by injecting strict directives into the system prompt and localizing internal workflow reasoning prompts.

## Behaviour Changes

**Before:** The AI Responder had no explicit language setting. It received English instructions internally and used English default prompts for Condition/Switch nodes, which often led to language drift during conversations.

**After:**
- Admins can select English or Vietnamese in Project Settings > AI Responder.
- The selection is persisted in `project.aiConfig.language`.
- The System Prompt now includes a strict enforcement instruction: "Bạn phải trả lời và suy luận bằng Tiếng Việt" or "You must reply and reason in English".
- Condition and Switch nodes automatically use localized Vietnamese default prompts when 'vi' is selected.

## Implementation Details

Phase 1: Updated `AiConfig` shared types and implemented the language selection UI in `AiResponderSettingsForm.tsx`.
Phase 2: Updated `WorkflowEngineService` to process the language configuration, inject system prompt instructions, and serve localized default routing prompts.
