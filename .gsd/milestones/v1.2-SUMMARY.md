# Milestone: v1.2 Form Reliability

## Completed: 2026-01-19

## Deliverables

- ✅ Dashboard receives real-time updates when a visitor submits a form (Phase 1)
- ✅ Dashboard consistently transitions form state from pending to submitted (Phase 1 & 3)
- ✅ enhance submission UI (Phase 2 & 3)

## Phases Completed

1. Phase 1: Real-time Form Synchronization
2. Phase 2: Submission UI Enhancements
3. Phase 3: Form Rendering Consolidation

## Metrics

- Phases: 3
- Verification status: PASS

## Lessons Learned

- **UI Consistency**: Introduced "premium" styles in Phase 2 but reverted in Phase 3 due to user preference/visual noise. Lesson: Stick to established design patterns unless explicitly redesigning the system.
- **Data Duplication**: Initially kept Request and Submission as separate bubbles. Phase 3 proved that consolidating them is a better UX for forms.
