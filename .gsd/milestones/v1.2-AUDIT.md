## Must-Haves Status

| Requirement                                                                                 | Verified | Evidence                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard receives real-time updates when a visitor submits a form                          | ✅       | Phase 1: SocketContext `FORM_SUBMITTED` implementation.               |
| Dashboard consistently transitions form state from pending to submitted without duplication | ✅       | Phase 3: Unified `FormRequestBubble` logic + `MessagePane` filtering. |
| Enhance submission UI (SPEC.md)                                                             | ✅       | Phase 2 & 3: Smart formatting implemented; visual redundancy removed. |

## Concerns

- None. The iteration in Phase 3 correctly addressed the user's feedback on the UI direction taken in Phase 2.

## Recommendations

1. Deploy to staging and verify that the "single bubble" transition feels smooth on slow connections (optimistic updates vs server confirmation).

## Technical Debt to Address

- None captured. The older `FormSubmissionBubble` styles were cleanly removed/reverted.

## Verdict: PASS
