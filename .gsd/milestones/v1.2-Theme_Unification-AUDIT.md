## Must-Haves Status

| Requirement                  | Verified | Evidence                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Shared theme tokens file     | ✅       | `packages/frontend/src/theme/tokens.ts` exists |
| Widget components refactored | ✅       | `grep "theme === 'light'"` → 0 matches         |
| Dashboard CSS documented     | ✅       | `packages/frontend/src/theme/README.md` exists |
| Visual parity verified       | ⏳       | Awaiting user confirmation                     |

## Phase Quality

### Phase 1: Define Shared Tokens & Widget CSS Variables

- **Plans:** 4
- **Gap closures:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ All plans have summaries
- **Quality:** GOOD — Clean execution, no iterations needed

### Phase 2: Align Dashboard CSS

- **Plans:** 1
- **Gap closures:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Quality:** GOOD — Scope was appropriately reduced (documentation vs refactoring)

### Phase 3: Verification

- **Plans:** 1
- **Gap closures:** 0
- **Status:** ⏳ In progress — awaiting human checkpoint
- **Quality:** N/A

## Concerns

1. **Dashboard CSS not refactored** — Dashboard keeps HSL format, widget uses hex. This is documented but not unified at code level.

2. **Background image overlay** — `ChatWindow.tsx` still has theme conditional for rgba background with images (technically 1 remaining conditional).

## Recommendations

1. Accept current implementation — color parity is documented, visual result is consistent.
2. Future: Consider a build step to auto-generate both CSS files from tokens.ts.

## Technical Debt

- [ ] `ChatWindow.tsx` has 1 remaining theme conditional for background image rgba (acceptable tradeoff)
- [ ] Pre-existing lint errors in `MessageList.tsx` (`timestamp` property) — unrelated to theme work

## Verdict

**Health: GOOD** — Milestone objectives substantially met. Phase 3 visual verification pending user confirmation.
